## Summary

Give one careful thought to your privacy needs, then be always able to swiftly apply what you decided.
## Problem

Users may get overwhelmed by the burden of deciding on privacy aspects each and every time they enrol in a new service. This may make them err on their decisions regarding privacy.
## Context

A user wants to start using a new service, which lets the user configure several privacy-related parameters. The user often does the same with new, different service providers.
## Goals

Allow users to provide a consistent privacy-related behaviour, while reducing their cognitive workload every time they enrol in a new service.
## Solution

Before contracting a service, the service provider retrieves the user preferences (exposed by their user agent, or at a well-known URI), and presents the user a comparison between their preferences and the privacy policies applied by default by the service operator, which in turn automatically adapts any configurable values to the userâ€™s declared preferences.
## Constraints And Consequences

This pattern requires sharing a machine-readable format to express and exchange definitions of privacy policies between the user agent and the service providers. Several such formats exist, yet they are not always supported by either user agents or by service providers. Besides, not all the privacy policy nuances can be expressed in existing privacy policy languages.
