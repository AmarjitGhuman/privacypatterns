## Summary

This pattern hides the actions taken by a user by adding fake actions
that are undistinguishable from real.
## Problem

When users interact with ICT systems their actions reveal a lot of
information about themselves. An option would be for users to not
perform such actions to protect their privacy. However, this is not
possible since users cannot completely avoid executing these actions
because they need to perform them to achieve a goal (e.g., search for
a word on the internet, send an email, search for a location).
## Context

This pattern is applicable when it is not possible to avoid executing,
delaying or obfuscating the content of an action.
## Goals

To hinder the adversaryâ€™s ability to infer the user behavior, as well
as her preferences.
## Motivating Example

Alice wants to search for an abortion clinic on Google, but she does
not want to reveal her intentions of abort to an adversary that may be
eavesdropping this search (e.g., ISP provider, system administrator of
her workplace, etc).
## Solution

Since the action must be accurately performed, an option to provide
privacy is to simultaneously perform other actions in such a way that
the adversary cannot distinguish real and fake (often called dummy)
actions.
## Constraints And Consequences

This pattern entails the need for extra resources to perform the dummy
actions, both at the side of the user that must repeat the action, and
at the server side that must process several actions. Sometimes it may
degrade the quality of service since the service provider cannot
personalize services. It has been demonstrated that generating dummies
that are perfectly indistinguishable from real actions (in terms of
content, timing, size, etc...) is very difficult.
## Known Uses

The use of this pattern has been proposed to protect privacy in
location based services (the user reveals several locations to the
service provider so that her real location is hidden), anonymous
communications (the user sends fake messages to fake recipients to
hide her profile), web searches (the user searches for fake terms to
hide her real preferences).
