##Intent##
Enable sharing of location or presence data where the user controls the timing and context.

Supports [user control](User-control) and [appropriateness](Appropriateness).

##Context##
When a user wants to share or broadcast location or other presence data that is contextually relevant and a full stream of data may be either noisy or intrusive.

##Problem##

How can a system broadcast a user's presence or location information to a social network without revealing sensitive locations or location histories or overwhelming recipients with noisy data?

##Solution##

While sharing access controls may allow constant access, only _broadcast_ presence information at the active choice of the user. 

###Examples###

####Foursquare check-in model####

##Forces/Concerns##

Always requiring active decision-making can burden the user with choices.
