## Definition

Data minimization is the principle of collecting less personal data or less specific data and retaining specific data for a shorter period of time in order to decrease privacy risks.

Data minimization techniques can decrease the risk of unexpected later access &mdash; through a security breach or lawful access request, for example &mdash; provide demonstrable clarity of data handling practices and remove the burdens of safe-guarding sensitive data.
