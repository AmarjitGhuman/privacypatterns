# About

Privacy represents a broad variety of concerns &mdash; subjective, contextual, hard-to-define &mdash; that real people have about the flows of personal information. Location-based services provide a key example: a growing field that uses potentially sensitive data, where adoption has been held back by privacy concerns.

Translating these concerns (as well as corporate and legal liability) into technical artifacts &mdash; a process known generally as "privacy-by-design" &mdash; has proven difficult. How can we best convert lawyer speak into engineering speak? How can problems be elegantly anticipated early in the development process?

Drawing inspiration from Christopher Alexander and the success of software design patterns in improving communication about tried-and-true practices, we hope privacy patterns will:

* standardize language for privacy-preserving technologies
* document common solutions to privacy problems
* help LBS designers identify and address privacy concerns

We're currently compiling some patterns to get started, but our goal is for this to be a living document constructed by the community of engineers, designers, lawyers and regulators involved in this topic.
