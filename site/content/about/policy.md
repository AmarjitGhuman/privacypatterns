## Privacy

**We want privacypatterns.org to act itself as a model for privacy on the Web.**

Privacypatterns.org only collects information about visitors for debugging and analytical purposes and when users actively contribute content to the site. Our servers run on [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/ "Amazon Web Services Privacy Notice") in the United States; we configure our Web server to retain protocol logs only in the case of errors or active debugging.

We use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html "Google Analytics Privacy Overview") to measure (in pseudonymous and aggregate form) use of this site. As described in Google's policy, we have configured Google to mask IP addresses and not to share analytics data.

We use [Disqus](http://docs.disqus.com/help/30/ "Disqus Privacy Policy") to manage comments on patterns on this site. Comments posted here will be publicly visible and may be associated with your name or email address. Disqus may collect pseudonymous information about your use of privacypatterns.org.

Collaboration on the content of privacypatterns.org is done via [Github](https://github.com/m0hit/privacypatterns "privacypatterns on Github.com"). Using Github to contribute content requires an account and contributions (pull requests, etc.) to our project will be publicly tied to that account. If you wish to contribute to the project non-publicly, please email us (via an anonymous remailer, if you wish).

Finally, we welcome contributions, comments, questions, suggestions and discussion via email. Unless instructed not to, we may share emails within our team or loop in other contributors; if you suggest content for the site and provide permission, we may post that content publicly with attribution. Otherwise, your email address and contents of your emails to us will remain as private as the rest of our personal email.
